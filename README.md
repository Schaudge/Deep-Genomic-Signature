# Deep Genomic Signature (DGS)
This repository is created for some codes, files, and supplementary materials for ISMB 2018 paper. 
I Provided some Python and R codes that I used in this project. Python codes are based on TensorFlow for Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE). R codes are for extraction of Deep High Weight (DHW) genes from the learned weight matrices in the implemented DAEs. 
We also uploaded Supplementary Materials including Supplementary Tables, mentioned in the original paper here in the .xlsx file. 
For more information please read the paper and cite accordingly.
